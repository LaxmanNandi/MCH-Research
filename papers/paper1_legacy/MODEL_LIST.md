## Models (8 total - Philosophy only, Closed models)

| Model | Trials | Methodology | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| GPT-5.2 | 100 | Standard script ✓ | Correct |
| GPT-4o | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |
| GPT-4o-mini | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |
| Claude Haiku | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |
| Gemini Flash | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |
| DeepSeek V3 | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |
| Llama 3.3 | ~50 | Flawed trial definition ✗ | Measurement errors |

**Total responses**: ~15,000 (mixed methodology)

## Domain
- **Philosophy only**: Consciousness prompts (Type 1, open-goal)

## Key Limitation
Inconsistent trial methodology reduced cross-model comparability. Only GPT-5.2 used the correct standard script.

## Data Location
Medical data was collected with standard script but **NOT analyzed** in Paper 1.
See Paper 2 for standardized cross-domain analysis.
